Due to limited licensing, the Approver team needs to verify that you are actively deploying code. To meet this requirement, developers must commit and merge code that triggers a build. This will generate an SCM-type entry in the Jenkins login report, which is used for validation.

After initiating your first deployment and receiving the Jenkins build confirmation email, please wait 3â€“4 days before submitting the AIMS request. This ensures that the necessary activity is visible for review and approval.
