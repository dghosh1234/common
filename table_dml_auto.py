Please find attached two documents that describe the steps required to generate UPSERT statements to support ADTF test case framework.

This code currently does not cover all possible scenarios, but it can serve as a starting point to minimize manual effort when creating DML statements.

I request you to review and use it over a couple of days with different use cases before providing feedback. This will help ensure your comments are more comprehensive and practical.

For any further clarification, feel free to reach out to me directly.
