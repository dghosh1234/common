It looks like you're trying to write Case One for a scenario where a user chooses to pause a custom query, particularly in situations involving:

Multiple source tables

Complex joins or groupings

Source and target table column names being different


Here's a cleaned-up and clear version of what you're trying to express:


---

âœ… Case One: When the user selects to pause a custom query

This case applies in the following scenarios:

When the query involves multiple source tables, complex joins, or GROUP BY clauses.

When the source and target table column names are different.


ðŸ“Œ In such cases, the paused query should follow this format:

SELECT 
    source_column_name1 AS target_column_name1,
    source_column_name2 AS target_column_name2,
    ...
FROM 
    source_table_name;

> Example: If your target table has a column customer_id but the source has cust_id, then the paused query should be:

SELECT 
    cust_id AS customer_id
FROM 
    source_table;



This ensures a smooth mapping between source and target during the transformation or migration process.

Would you like me to help format this into documentation, add more examples, or write other cases?
