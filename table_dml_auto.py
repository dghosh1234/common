The concept allows you to create multiple test cases from the source table. Each test case is defined by a group name (e.g., TEST_CASE_1, but any name can be used).

A separate WHERE condition for the INSERT record set

A separate WHERE condition for the UPDATE record set


This flexibility enables you to simulate various scenarios by controlling which source records are selected for insertion or update into the target tabl
